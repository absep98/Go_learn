Perfect. January is now **execution mode**.
No debate. No optimization. Just reps.

Below is your **locked January daily schedule** — designed to **force an exit from SDET** and move you toward **more money** via a backend role.

---

# 🔒 JANUARY 2026 — DAILY SCHEDULE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Theme:** Build proof. Kill confusion. Create leverage.

Total time: **~2.5 hours/day**
(Doable even on bad days. Powerful on good ones.)

---

## 🕕 WEEKDAYS (Mon–Fri)

### 🔥 Block 1: Backend Build (90 min)

**Time:** Anytime after work (pick ONE fixed slot)

**Rules:**

* Code only
* No tutorials
* No refactors unless broken
* One repo, one project

**What you do here:**

* APIs
* DB logic
* Auth
* Concurrency
* Error handling
* Real backend pain

If you open YouTube → you failed the block.

---

### 🧠 Block 2: System Design (30 min)

**Immediately after Block 1**

**Format (strict):**

* Pick ONE question about *your project*
* Write answers in plain English

Examples:

* “What breaks at 10k users?”
* “Where would caching help?”
* “How would I add async jobs?”
* “How would I scale DB reads?”

📌 No theory. No notes from videos.
Only *your system*.

---

### 📝 Block 3: Proof & Memory (15 min)

**End the day here**

You must write **one of these**:

* README update
* Design decision note
* Bug you hit + fix
* Tradeoff you chose

This is what converts effort → confidence.

---

## 🧊 WEEKENDS (Sat–Sun)

No heroics. No laziness. Controlled output.

### Saturday (2–3 hrs total)

* Extend core feature
* Add one “production-like” thing:

  * Rate limiting
  * Caching
  * Async worker
  * Background job

### Sunday (1.5–2 hrs)

* Review entire project
* Clean code where needed
* Update README
* Write **one system design story**

Then STOP.
Rest is allowed. Guilt is not.

---

## 🚫 JANUARY BANS (VERY IMPORTANT)

These are **hard bans**, not suggestions:

* ❌ Trading
* ❌ New project ideas
* ❌ New tech stacks
* ❌ “Just checking YouTube”
* ❌ Rewriting from scratch

If it’s not:

> Backend role → money → exit SDET
> It’s noise.

---

## 📍 Weekly Milestones (so you know you’re on track)

### End of Week 1

* Project skeleton
* CRUD works
* DB connected
* Repo looks “serious”

### End of Week 2

* Auth done
* One concurrency use-case
* Error handling solid

### End of Week 3

* One scaling-related feature
* Design notes written
* Can explain architecture clearly

### End of Week 4

* Clean README
* Diagrams (even simple)
* 2–3 interview-ready stories

---

## 🧠 One rule that will save you

**Never ask:**

> “Is this enough?”

**Always ask:**

> “Does this increase my probability of exiting SDET?”

That’s it.

---

## Final lock-in (say this out loud today)

> “For January 2026, my only job is to become undeniable as a backend developer.”

Next step 👇
If you want, I’ll **force-pick the backend project idea for you** (no overthinking).
Say: **“Pick the project.”**
