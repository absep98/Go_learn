Locked. **1.5 hrs/day is enough** if we cut noise and go straight for leverage.
Today is **Jan 2** → we start **Day 1 execution**. No warming up.

# 🔥 WEEK 1 GOAL (Jan 2–7)

**Have a running Go backend with DB-backed CRUD.**
If this exists, you’re officially out of “talking” mode.

---

# 🗓️ DAY-BY-DAY BREAKDOWN (1.5 HR / DAY)

## 📍 **DAY 1 – Jan 2 (TODAY)**

**Goal:** Project skeleton + server running

### ⏱️ 90 minutes — do ONLY this

#### 1️⃣ Create the repo (10 min)

* Name it something serious:

  * `personal-analytics-backend`
* Initialize Go module
* Basic folder structure:

  ```
  cmd/
  internal/
    handlers/
    models/
    db/
  ```

#### 2️⃣ HTTP server (40 min)

* Use `net/http` or `gin` (your choice, don’t overthink)
* Create:

  * `GET /health` → returns OK
* Run server locally

👉 **Checkpoint:**
You can hit `/health` in browser/Postman.

#### 3️⃣ Config + env setup (20 min)

* Port from env
* DB connection string placeholder
* `.env` or config struct

#### 4️⃣ README start (20 min)

Write:

* What this service is
* Tech stack
* One paragraph: *“Why this exists”*

✍️ This matters more than you think.

---

### 📝 End of Day Proof (mandatory – 5 min)

Write a note:

> “Today I set up a Go backend with a running HTTP server and basic project structure.”

If this exists, the day counts.

---

## 📍 **DAY 2 – Jan 3**

**Goal:** Database connected

* Choose DB:

  * PostgreSQL (preferred) OR
  * SQLite (fine for now)
* Connect DB
* Create `users` table
* Test insert + read (no API yet)

👉 Achievement feeling: *“Data is real now.”*

---

## 📍 **DAY 3 – Jan 4**

**Goal:** First real API

* `POST /entries`
* Entry fields:

  * user_id (temporary)
  * text
  * mood (int/string)
  * timestamp
* Save to DB
* Basic validation

---

## 📍 **DAY 4 – Jan 5**

**Goal:** Read API

* `GET /entries`
* Support:

  * date filtering
* Return JSON cleanly
* Handle empty cases

---

## 📍 **DAY 5 – Jan 6**

**Goal:** Error handling + cleanup

* Centralized error responses
* Proper HTTP status codes
* Refactor messy code
* Small README update

---

## 📍 **DAY 6 – Jan 7**

**Goal:** Week 1 consolidation

* Review whole flow
* Add indexes where needed
* Write:

  * “What I built this week”
  * “What I’d improve next”

Then STOP. No overwork.

---

# 🚫 STRICT RULES (DON’T BREAK THESE)

* ❌ No auth yet (Week 2)
* ❌ No AI yet
* ❌ No frontend
* ❌ No optimization obsession

Skeleton first. Muscles later.

---

# 🧠 Mental Model FOR TODAY

Today is not about skill.
It’s about **starting momentum**.

Once the repo exists and the server runs:

* Fear drops
* Confidence rises
* Clarity follows

---

## Final instruction for **RIGHT NOW**

👉 **Start Day 1 immediately.**
When done, come back and tell me:

* What you finished
* What blocked you (if anything)

I’ll unblock you fast and move you to Day 2.

This is how exits are built.
