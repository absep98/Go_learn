Good—you’re asking the *right* question. Let me make this **crystal clear**, no theory fog.

You **do NOT** need to already “know Go” to start.
You **learn Go by completing today’s task**, not before it.

Below is **exactly how you proceed TODAY**, step-by-step, including **what to learn, when, and how much**.

---

## 🔑 The One Rule You Will Follow

> **Only learn what blocks the next line of code. Nothing more.**

If something doesn’t block you **right now**, you ignore it.

# 📍 DAY 1 — HOW YOU ACTUALLY EXECUTE (GO VERSION)

### ⏱️ Total time: ~90 minutes

No extra study. No courses.

---

## STEP 1 — Create a Go server (you WILL copy first)

**Time: 20–25 min**

You don’t “learn HTTP servers” first.
You **copy a minimal example**, then run it.

### What you do:

1. Google:
   **“simple http server golang net/http”**
2. Open official Go docs or a small blog
3. Copy this **minimal pattern**:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"net/http"
)

func healthHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	fmt.Fprintln(w, "OK")
}

func main() {
	http.HandleFunc("/health", healthHandler)
	http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
```

4. Run it:

```bash
go run main.go
```

5. Hit:

```
http://localhost:8080/health
```

👉 If this works, **you are officially building in Go**.

❌ You do NOT need to understand everything yet.

---

## STEP 2 — Learn ONLY what you just used

**Time: 10–15 min**

Now you ask:

* What is `main`?
* What is `http.HandleFunc`?
* What is `ListenAndServe`?

You read **only enough** to answer those.

You are NOT:

* Learning Go syntax fully
* Watching playlists
* Reading about frameworks

---

## STEP 3 — Put code into structure

**Time: 25–30 min**

Now refactor slightly:

```
cmd/server/main.go
internal/handlers/health.go
```

This forces you to learn:

* Packages
* Imports

Again:

* Google: “golang packages example”
* Apply immediately
* Move on

---

## STEP 4 — Config from env (very basic)

**Time: 10–15 min**

You Google:

> “read env variables in golang”

You learn:

* `os.Getenv`
* Nothing else

Use it once. Done.

---

## STEP 5 — Write 5 lines in README

**Time: 5–10 min**

Write:

* What this service does
* How to run it

This locks learning into memory.

---

# 🧠 IMPORTANT: THIS IS HOW LEARNING LOOKS NOW

You are **not learning Go**.
You are **solving micro-problems using Go**.

Each micro-problem teaches you:

* Syntax
* Patterns
* Confidence

This is how real backend devs work.

---

## 🚫 What you must NOT do

* ❌ “Let me finish Go basics first”
* ❌ “I’ll watch a 3-hour tutorial”
* ❌ “I’m not ready yet”

Those thoughts are **SDET safety patterns**.
We’re breaking them.

---

## 💡 Why this works (listen carefully)

Interviews don’t ask:

> “Have you learned Go?”

They ask:

> “Have you built systems?”

This method produces:

* Systems
* Stories
* Proof

Fast.

---

## Final reassurance (important)

Feeling confused = **you’re doing it right**
Feeling “not ready” = **normal**
Waiting to feel ready = **career death**

---

## Your ONLY task right now

👉 Start **STEP 1**.
Don’t think. Don’t plan. Just run the server.

When `/health` works, come back and tell me:

* “Server is running”
* Or exactly where you got stuck

I’ll guide the next move immediately.
