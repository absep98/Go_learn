Perfect. I’m locking this in for you.
No ambiguity. No “maybe later”. We move.

# 🚀 THE PROJECT (FORCED PICK)

## **“AI-assisted Personal Analytics Backend”**

*A backend-first system designed like a paid SaaS, built in Go.*

Think of it as:

* Mood / habit / activity tracking (data in)
* AI-assisted insights & summaries (value out)
* Clean APIs that a web/mobile app could pay for

You’re **not building a UI**.
You’re building the **engine people pay for**.

This aligns with:

* Your interest in AI
* Your past mood-tracking ideas
* Backend + Go
* Future passive income potential
* Backend interview expectations

---

## 🧠 What this project proves to recruiters

When done, you can confidently say:

> “I designed and built a backend service in Go with auth, async processing, caching, AI integration, and scalability considerations.”

That sentence alone changes your profile.

# 🧱 CORE FEATURES (LOCKED SCOPE)

You are building **only this** in January.

### 1️⃣ Auth & Users

* JWT-based auth
* User registration / login
* Middleware for protected routes

📌 Shows: real backend, security basics

---

### 2️⃣ Data Ingestion APIs

Users can send:

* Mood
* Notes / text
* Tags
* Timestamped events

REST endpoints like:

* `POST /entries`
* `GET /entries?from=&to=`

📌 Shows: API design, DB modeling

---

### 3️⃣ Database Layer

* PostgreSQL (preferred) or SQLite (acceptable)
* Proper schema
* Indexing where it matters

📌 Shows: you’re not afraid of data

---

### 4️⃣ AI Processing (Async)

* Background worker (goroutine / worker pool)
* Takes user data
* Generates summaries / insights (mock or real LLM)

Important: **async**, not inline.

📌 Shows: concurrency + real-world design

---

### 5️⃣ Caching & Performance

* Cache recent summaries
* Avoid recomputation
* Simple in-memory or Redis-style interface

📌 Shows: scaling awareness

---

### 6️⃣ System Design Thinking

Not features — **decisions**:

* Why async?
* Why this DB?
* What breaks at scale?
* How would you charge per user?

📌 This is interview gold.

# 🗓️ JANUARY EXECUTION PLAN (WEEK BY WEEK)

## 🔹 Week 1: Foundation

**Goal:** Running backend, no excuses.

* Project setup (Go modules)
* Basic REST server
* DB connection
* CRUD for entries
* Repo + README started

✅ Achievement feeling: *“This is real backend.”*

---

## 🔹 Week 2: Auth + Structure

**Goal:** Production-ish behavior.

* JWT auth
* Middleware
* User isolation (each user sees only their data)
* Error handling done properly

✅ Achievement feeling: *“I could ship this internally.”*

---

## 🔹 Week 3: AI + Concurrency

**Goal:** Differentiator.

* Background worker
* Async summary generation
* Goroutines + channels
* Status tracking (pending / completed)

✅ Achievement feeling: *“This is interview-level.”*

---

## 🔹 Week 4: Scale Thinking + Polish

**Goal:** Proof & storytelling.

* Caching
* Rate limiting OR basic metrics
* Clean README
* Architecture diagram
* Design notes

✅ Achievement feeling: *“I can defend this system.”*

---

# 🧠 HOW YOU “LEARN” DURING THIS

You learn **only when blocked**.

Examples:

* Don’t know JWT in Go → learn JWT
* Don’t know goroutines → learn goroutines
* Don’t know indexing → learn indexing

No syllabus. No playlists.

This keeps learning **relevant and sticky**.

---

# 🚫 WHAT YOU ARE NOT DOING

* ❌ No frontend
* ❌ No perfection
* ❌ No monetization now
* ❌ No switching stacks
* ❌ No new ideas

One project. One identity.

---

# 🎯 END-OF-JANUARY OUTCOME (VERY IMPORTANT)

By Jan 31, you will have:

* A serious Go backend repo
* Clear backend identity
* System design confidence
* Reduced fear of being “just SDET”
* A foundation that **can make money later**

That’s massive progress.

---

## NEXT STEP (DO THIS TODAY)

Reply with:
1️⃣ **“Confirmed.”**
2️⃣ Tell me **how many hours/day** you can commit (weekday vs weekend).

I’ll then:

* Break **Week 1 into daily tasks**
* Give you the **exact Day 1 setup**
* And remove all remaining ambiguity

We’re executing now.
